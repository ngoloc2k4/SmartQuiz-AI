# Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for QuizMaster AI

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of the QuizMaster AI system is to provide an intelligent quiz platform that automatically generates questions, evaluates user answers, and offers detailed explanations. This system is designed to enhance learning outcomes by offering immediate feedback, personalized quizzes, and AI-driven content generation.

### 1.2 Scope
The system consists of three primary components:
- **Front-End:** A responsive web application built with ReactJS and styled using TailwindCSS. It handles user interactions, displays quizzes, and shows results.
- **Back-End:** A RESTful API developed with Java Spring Boot (or alternatively Flask, if required) that manages user data, quizzes, questions, and results. The back-end connects to a MongoDB database.
- **AI Integration:** Uses external AI APIs (e.g., OpenAI or DeepSeek models) to automatically generate quiz questions, evaluate answers, and provide explanations.

### 1.3 Intended Audience
- **Students:** Use the system for self-assessment and learning.
- **Teachers/Administrators:** Manage and create quizzes, monitor user progress, and update content.
- **Developers:** Maintain and extend the system functionality.
- **System Administrators:** Monitor performance, scalability, and security.

- **Quiz Management:** Creation, modification, deletion, and retrieval of quizzes.
- **Question Management:** Adding, updating, and deleting questions; storing question metadata (difficulty, category, etc.).
- **Quiz Execution:** Delivering quizzes to users, collecting responses, and timing quizzes.
- **Result Evaluation:** Automatically grading quizzes and providing detailed explanations.
- **AI Integration:** Automatically generating questions and explanations based on selected topics and difficulty levels.
- **Reporting and Analytics:** Tracking user progress, quiz performance, and providing recommendations for further learning.

### 2.3 User Characteristics
- Users should have basic computer and Internet literacy.
- Students may have limited technical knowledge, so the UI must be intuitive and easy to navigate.
- Administrators and teachers will require more advanced features for quiz management.

### 2.4 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Users will have a stable Internet connection.
- The external AI APIs (e.g., OpenAI) will be accessible and reliable.
- The system will be deployed on cloud platforms (e.g., Heroku for backend, Vercel for frontend).
- Node.js v20 is used for the front-end environment.
- Java Spring Boot (or Flask) is used for the back-end.
- MongoDB is the primary database, either hosted on Atlas or locally.
