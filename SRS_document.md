## 5. Interface Requirements

### 5.1. User Interface (UI)
- **General UI Principles:**
    - **Clean and Consistent Design:**  Follow a consistent visual theme throughout the application, using TailwindCSS utility classes for styling. Maintain consistent typography, color schemes, and UI element styling.
    - **Intuitive Navigation:**  Implement clear and logical navigation menus and breadcrumbs to allow users to easily find and access different sections of the application. Use a consistent navigation structure across the platform.
    - **User-Friendly Forms:**  Design forms that are easy to fill out with clear labels, input hints, and validation messages. Use appropriate input types and auto-completion where possible.
    - **Responsive Layout:**  Ensure the UI is fully responsive and adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile). Test responsiveness across various devices and browsers.
    - **Accessibility Considerations:**  Design the UI with accessibility in mind, adhering to WCAG guidelines (see NFR14).
- **Specific UI Elements and Components:**
    - **Login/Registration Pages:** Simple and straightforward forms with clear instructions and error messages. Social login options (future enhancement) could be considered.
    - **Quiz Listing/Browsing Pages:**  Grid or list views to display available quizzes with clear titles, descriptions, categories, and difficulty levels. Search and filtering options for easy quiz discovery.
    - **Quiz Taking Interface:**  Clean and distraction-free layout for presenting quiz questions and answer options. Clear progress indicators, timer display (if applicable), and navigation controls.
    - **Result Display Page:**  Comprehensive result summary including score, percentage, time taken, correct/incorrect answers, and detailed explanations for each question. Visually appealing presentation of results and performance metrics.
    - **Admin Dashboard (Teachers/Administrators):**  Centralized dashboard for managing quizzes, questions, users, and reports. Intuitive interfaces for quiz creation, editing, and content management.

- **Data Format:** JSON for request and response bodies.
- **HTTP Methods:**  Standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) will be used appropriately for CRUD operations and other API actions.
- **Endpoint Structure:**  API endpoints should be logically structured and follow RESTful conventions (e.g., `/api/users`, `/api/quizzes`, `/api/questions`).
- **Authentication:** JWT-based authentication for securing API endpoints (see NFR4).
- **Error Handling:**  API should return consistent and informative error responses in JSON format, including appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 400 Bad Request, 401 Unauthorized, 404 Not Found, 500 Internal Server Error).
- **API Documentation:** API documentation will be maintained using Postman Collections (as specified) and potentially OpenAPI/Swagger for interactive documentation and exploration. Documentation should include endpoint descriptions, request/response examples, request parameters, and authentication requirements.
- **Versioning (Future Consideration):** API versioning strategy should be considered for future updates and changes to the API (e.g., using URL-based versioning like `/api/v1/`).
- **Rate Limiting (see NFR7):** API endpoints should be rate-limited to prevent abuse and ensure system stability.
- **CORS Configuration (see NFR5):**  Proper CORS policies should be implemented to control cross-origin access to the API.
- **Example API Endpoints (Illustrative):**

## 6. System Architecture Overview

### 6.1. Front-End
- **Technology:** ReactJS, TailwindCSS, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML5, CSS3
- **Structure:** Component-based architecture using React components. State management using React Context API or a state management library (e.g., Redux or Zustand - decision to be made). Routing using React Router for client-side navigation. API communication using Axios or Fetch API.
- **Modules:**
    - **User Authentication Module:** Components for login, registration, profile management, and JWT token handling.
    - **Quiz Browsing and Listing Module:** Components for displaying quiz lists, search, filters, and quiz previews.
    - **Quiz Taking Module:** Components for displaying questions, answer options, timer, navigation controls, and quiz submission.
    - **Result Display Module:** Components for presenting quiz results, explanations, and performance summaries.
    - **Admin Dashboard Module:** Components for quiz management, question management, user management (for administrators/teachers).
    - **UI Library/Component Library:** Reusable UI components built with TailwindCSS for consistent styling and maintainability.
- **Deployment:** Hosted on cloud platforms like Vercel/Netlify for static asset hosting and serverless functions (if needed for backend logic in the front-end).

### 6.2. Back-End
- **Technology:** Java Spring Boot (or Flask if preferred for quicker prototyping initially), MongoDB (or PostgreSQL for relational data - decision based on data modeling needs and scalability considerations), Java/Python (depending on chosen framework), RESTful API framework.
- **Architecture:** Layered architecture or microservices-inspired modules (initial phase might be monolithic with modular design principles). RESTful API exposed to the front-end. JWT-based authentication and authorization. Data persistence using MongoDB (or PostgreSQL). Integration with external AI APIs.
- **Modules (Spring Boot example):**
    - **User Service:** Handles user registration, login, profile management, authentication, and authorization.
    - **Quiz Service:**  Manages quiz creation, retrieval, updating, deletion, and quiz lifecycle.
    - **Question Service:** Manages question creation, retrieval, updating, deletion, and question bank operations.
    - **Result Service:**  Handles quiz execution, result evaluation, storing results, and retrieving results.
    - **AI Integration Service:**  Encapsulates the logic for interacting with external AI APIs for question and explanation generation.
    - **Reporting and Analytics Service:** (Initially basic) Handles user progress tracking, quiz performance analytics, and feedback collection.
- **Deployment:** Containerized using Docker (for packaging and consistency) and deployed on platforms like Heroku, AWS ECS/EKS, or Google Cloud Run for scalable backend hosting. Load balancing for distributing traffic across multiple backend instances.

### 6.3. AI Integration
- **API Integration:** The back-end integrates with external AI services (e.g., OpenAI, DeepSeek) via their REST APIs. API keys and authentication credentials should be securely managed (e.g., using environment variables, secrets management services).
- **Abstraction Layer:** An AI Integration Service module in the backend should act as an abstraction layer to decouple the core quiz management logic from specific AI API implementations. This allows for easier swapping of AI providers in the future.
- **Data Handling:**  Data exchanged with AI APIs (topics, difficulty levels, question prompts, AI responses) should be handled securely and logged appropriately for debugging and monitoring (while respecting data privacy).
- **Error Handling and Fallback:**  Robust error handling for AI API calls, including retry mechanisms, timeouts, and fallback strategies in case of AI API outages or failures (e.g., using cached questions, manual question fallback).
- **Content Validation and Moderation:**  Mechanisms for validating and moderating AI-generated content (questions and explanations) to ensure accuracy, relevance, and appropriateness.  Potentially incorporate human review/editing workflows for AI-generated content.
